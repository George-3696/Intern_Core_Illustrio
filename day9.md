# Day 9 

On day 9 I figured out how to use the *Angular* Material component through out the angular app, i used the material component on the to do list app, and then i was asked to look for sorting for a random number in an array and to create a *json* file with country code and country description, the algorithm for sorting the random nnumber from ascending to descending is to find the difference between one number with every number on the array and for all the number in the array 

The number which has more negative values is considered as lowest value and then arranged accordingly, The JSon which we are asked to create has the data about country codes for reprresenting the currency values of all the countries, we collected the data from the wikepedia page and used it in our json file to create an object of values with country codes.
