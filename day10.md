# Day 10 

On day 10 i learnt about how to solve the three problems which was given to us the other day, the answer for the harry potter problem was differnet for as i calculated in a different way, the algorithm for the harry potter is a liitle challenging to come up with but both the other problems were solvable every one got a different way of solving the other two problems each answer and algorith is different from one another.

On the afternoon i was asked to correct all the *TS* file which has **Typescript** syntax which needs to changed to **Dart** syntax which is different from the Typescript it was challenging coz i have no idea about dart and the syntax of it so had to search for every syntax of dart for changing the typescript syntax, There is 100 more Ts files to change, I learnt a little bit about the Dart language.
