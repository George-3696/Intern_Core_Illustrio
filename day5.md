# Day 5 

On the 5th day i had a coding session with my mentor where he showed me how to create a **flutter app** as he was we are assked to observe the coding part the most of the part im not familiar with the code coz it was a different programming language but i can understand what he is actually trying to do.
 
And then i was assingned to do some work in the data collection topic about how a particular app or web app collects data to show in their *user interface* this helped mehow to see the actual data collected to show in a **ui** the applicaation that i used to refer was 

- **OLA**
-**REDBUS**
**YOUTUBE**

For the rest of the day i looked into vim plugins how to install them in the code editior,i also learnt about the *markdown language* in our intern meeting from what i learnt in the past this gives a idea of how *HTML* was created for the computer to understand what we actually trying to say and to mark the headings and paragraphs etc,themost common things in a *Markuo Language* are

-*#* used for Heading 
-*-*for listing 
-*1* number points 
- * * for italic fonts 
- ** ** for highlighting words 

These are the most common things used in the *markdown language* these language is uded back in the days to understand the content of the internt page for better understanding,
