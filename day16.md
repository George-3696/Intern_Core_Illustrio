# Day 16

It is almost more than two weeks, the most i learn and hear about is problem solving skills and now there is another two important skill is abstract, data structure and algorithms these are the main skills the internship program is pushing us to do, As these skills i have  never heard and learned in my young ages it is a new and different things for me to learn. its also seeing things in a new angle to look at a lift and see it as an abstraction is totally different experience for me,

From what i have learnt im only at the begining state of my level and skill there is so much to learn and accomplish, there is great and young minds here with different skill and character, and the the work im doing is still going on as there is a 100 files and every now and then there is a new type of syntax as i go through every file to change the TS file to a DART file i have learnt many dart syntax not most of them just to know what the actuall syntax is and why are they used.
