#Day 12 

This day i finished my first 30 **Typescript** files, the next work for me is to create a **JavaScript** program to change the editing process through a program from a Ts file to a Dart file, what i learnt from this is more about the javascript and to think and write my own code for this kind of problem is new for me and im struggling a lot,i found a solution to this problem which is im taking the Ts file as a whole string and then by manipulating the string i can change them to a dart syntax 

And then we were taught about **GITHUB** i have a small experience not that i mastered it but i understand what it is and why it is used,**GIT** is used widely for the version control of the software or a article whatever you want to control the version of the file,It pushes the local file to a cloud file and if we made a change in our local file and we upload it it wont copy the whole thing it looks for the changes and then uploads the changes, **GITHUB** can also be used to create a branch for our own repository we can upload our updated files to the branch and if we made a mistake or something went wrong we jump to our older version of our file which is very useful for the version control for any software or controling the version of our own file .
