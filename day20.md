# Day 20 

The session we had is about programming language and the very basic of the programming language, and the lift problem which we are given to solve is done by us, the goal is to find a working formula of some kind for the lift to operate, the problem is if the answer we have come up with if we coded that formula and give it to the lift it should run properly, so the formula i came up with is difference between input floor and the current floor the value we get decides which floor we go and the negative or positive value decides if it goes up or down.

**x = I.F - C.F **
- I.F Input Floor 
-C.F current Floor 

from this problem i learned that everything should be abstracted first and then it can be used to create whatever we wish to create, also to think that lift has these complex situations and many other possiblities of error it is really eye opening from travelling in lift so many times i never thought that lift would have these complex situations.

At session we had the topic of syntax i know a little things about this concept but i got a full view of how it can be structured, i learnt about the let and const syntax even though it is a simple i never it can have multiple possible ways of assinging a value to a single const and let,I know about creating a value by assinging it to name but assinging the value to a different name at the same ideentifier is new thing for and that is the very extent of the topic let and cosnt it cant go depper than that ( thats what she said--Micheal Scott )....
