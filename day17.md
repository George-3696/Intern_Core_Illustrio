# Day 17 

Programming Language we are stepping in to the content we are waiting for, as a self learner of some programming language i dont even bother to learn about the orgin story of programming languages and who came up with which language and what a computer does at a very long time ago and how does it actually works and everything, i know a little about the computers and how they function but the lecture we had about how computer works gave me a clear view, i know that computers are basically a huge number of switches but how that switches work is the part i did not know, And i got a clarity of how the switches work in a computer, even when im pressing a key each and every i press it switches on and off its switches.

The Langauge that computers understand are the **UTF** which has the characters like a english language, in this UTF characters there are different bits which are basically switches like UTF"16",
which is basically a 16 bytes meaning it has 16 switches.
