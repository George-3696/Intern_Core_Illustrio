# Day 6 

Its almosst a week now,new challanges everyday as usual we had our intern meeting and other mentor assingments and whatsoever, this time the intern meeting is all about to make us think ,there is a puzzle which hadbridges and islands where *euler* the guy who come up with a new math theorem which describes what is solvable and not 

after that i tried to learn about the new frame work called *angular* which is so complex compared to *react* angular components are arranged properly this will be useful if the web app is more complex but the learning process is so steep compared to react, the component rendering process is litle bit difficult,

the google searching helps but not entirely just a little, as my mentor says it can be done only by **Trial and Error**
