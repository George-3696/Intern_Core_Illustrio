#Day 11

This day i learnt about the **Dart** programming language a little more than yesterday i learnt a little bit more about the syntax format of dart, as i was asked to change the **TypeScript** file to dart i had to go through the dart documentation to find out the alternative for typescript syntax, my mentor helped me how to figure out the syntax format and the techincal words for each particular syntax to search for google to find the dart syntax for TypeScript

The dart files are for *Surfboard Data Model* as the name goes it has all the data models for the payment services like,
-**Name**
**Description**
**Customer ID**
and many other data for different kind of purposes,i did about 30 dart files this day from going through this amount of dart files the syntax format used in this data model is understandable now i can understand a little about the logic of the data model used in the code and it is now readable and understand what the code is trying to do with it .
