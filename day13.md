# Day13

This day i was assingned to the **dart** converting task and when i tried to do the coding part i struggled really bad i was looking for the method to do so and i dint find any good answer for my problem i was trying different things to solve the problem, i broke down the problem and wrote the steps which should be converted and not but when i tried to implement those instructions to code i struggled this shows that i have to learn more about logical coding about how to solve the problem through coding

i asked help about how to do this,abraham showed me how to do this from what i saw him writting down the  **javaScript** code he just wrote it down in minutes and taught me how his code works, from that i know im no close to that level i need to learn a lot.
