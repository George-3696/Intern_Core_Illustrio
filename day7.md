# Day 7 

 On day 7 the programming concepts are introduced the very basic of programming about how it all starts why do we need to program and everything, i was also asked to solve a problem in a language i was familiar with im trying to do that,with the problem i need to learn how to break down the problem  and solve the aactual problem in a programming language 

 i also learnt about using the *angular component* across the webpage, it is a little bit different than i thought,learned available components for angular known as *angular material*, it has different pre coded components for us to use,some of the components are  
- list
-button 
-grid
 
these components can be just used from the angular material to our desired webpage,
